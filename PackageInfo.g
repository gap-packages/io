##  Status information. Currently the following cases are recognized:
##    "accepted"      for successfully refereed packages
##    "deposited"     for packages for which the GAP developers agreed 
##                    to distribute them with the core GAP system
##    "dev"           for development versions of packages 
##    "other"         for all other packages
##
# Status := "accepted",
Status := "deposited",

##  You must provide the next two entries if and only if the status is 
##  "accepted" because is was successfully refereed:
# format: 'name (place)'
# CommunicatedBy := "Mike Atkinson (St. Andrews)",
#CommunicatedBy := "",
# format: mm/yyyy
# AcceptDate := "08/1999",
