  [1X9.1 [33X[0;0YIntroduction[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhenever  one  needs  to  do  input/output on more than one connection (file
  descriptor) at a time, some code is needed to organise the I/O multiplexing.
  Due to the single-threaded nature of the current [5XGAP[105X language one has to use
  [2XIO_select[102X  ([14X3.2-55[114X)  and  some buffering and queueing to organise this. This
  chapter  describes  a  relative  generic  implementation of I/O-multiplexing
  using  so-called  [2XIOHub[102X  ([14X9.2-1[114X)  objects.  The  basic idea is that an [2XIOHub[102X
  ([14X9.2-1[114X)  object  handles  lots  of  I/O  connections  at  the  same time and
  maintains  a  buffer  for each of them. There is a very simple protocol that
  marks  chunks  of  data  (called  [21Xmessages[121X)  and whenever a message has been
  received completely it is collected in the input queue of the [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X),
  marked with the number of the connection it came from. Rather than sending a
  message  away  in  one  go,  one  would  always  schedule  it for sending by
  appending  it  to the output queue. The operation [2XDoIO[102X ([14X9.2-13[114X), when called
  often enough, will then make sure that the message is sent away eventually.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIn  this section, we simply describe the functions and operations to create,

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ya positive integer[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  operation  adds  a  new  connection to the [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X) object [3Xh[103X. The
  arguments  [3Xi[103X and [3Xo[103X must be Unix file descriptors or [22X0[122X and [3Xi[103X must be open for
  reading  if it is positive and [3Xo[103X must be open for writing if it is positive.
  It is allowed that both file descriptors are equal, but they may not both be
  equal  to  [22X0[122X.  The  operation returns a positive integer which is the number
  under  which  this new connection will be administrated in the [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X)
  object. Note that this number is specific to the object [3Xh[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFrom the moment these file descriptors are registered with the [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X)
  object,  every  subsequent  call  to  [2XDoIO[102X ([14X9.2-13[114X) will try to do input and
  output  on  them.  This  means  in  particular  that  the other side of this
  connection should be in the same initial state of the protocol. Usually this
  will  be achieved by them being added as a new connection to a corresponding
  [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X) object on the other side at the same time.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  argument  [3Xh[103X  must  be  an  [2XIOHub[102X  ([14X9.2-1[114X) object and [3Xnr[103X the number of a
  connection  which  was  previously  returned  by  [2XNewConnection[102X ([14X9.2-2[114X). The

  [33X[0;0YThe  argument  [3Xh[103X must be an [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X) object, [3Xaddr[103X an IP address or host
  name  as  a  string  and  [3Xport[103X  a port number (see also [2XIO_MakeIPAddressPort[102X
  ([14X4.3-6[114X)).  This  operation  creates a new socket, binds it to the IP address
  and  port  and  attaches it to the [2XIOHub[102X ([14X9.2-1[114X) object. From this moment on
  the operation [2XDoIO[102X ([14X9.2-13[114X) will accept new bidirectional TCP/IP connections
  on  that  socket  and  add  them to [3Xh[103X. The operation returns either the file

  serving  socket  attached  to  it via [2XAttachServingSocket[102X ([14X9.2-4[114X), otherwise
  [9Xfail[109X  is  returned  and  nothing  happens.  One  more connection is accepted
  through  the  serving  socket.  It  is  added  as a new bidirectional TCP/IP
  connection  to  the  [2XIOHub[102X  ([14X9.2-1[114X)  object and the new connection number is
  returned. Note first that this operation blocks until a new connection comes
  in.  Note furthermore that this operation is usually called automatically in
  [2XDoIO[102X  ([14X9.2-13[114X)  whenever  a new connection has come in, which is reported in
  the  internal  [2XIO_select[102X ([14X3.2-55[114X) call. So usually, the client code does not
  have to call this operation at all.[133X

  integer which is the number of an open connection of [3Xh[103X which can be used for
  output.  The  argument  [3Xst[103X  must be a [5XGAP[105X string. This operation appends the
  message  [3Xst[103X  to the end of the output queue for the connection [3Xnr[103X. Note that
  at this stage no output is actually performed automatically. One has to call
  [2XDoIO[102X ([14X9.2-13[114X) subsequently to actually send the message away.[133X

  is  positive,  this operation returns the earliest message which has come in
  from  connection number [3Xnr[103X and has not yet been returned by [2XGetInput[102X before.
  This  message  is  then  removed  from  the input queue. If there is no such
  message,  then  [9Xfalse[109X  is returned. A message is returned as a plain list of
  length [22X2[122X where the first entry is the connection number it came from and the
  second  entry is a string containing the message itself. If [3Xnr[103X is equal to [22X0[122X

  [3Xaddress[103X  can  either  be  a  host  name  or an IP address and [3Xport[103X is a port

  argument [3Xblock[103X must be [9Xtrue[109X or [9Xfalse[109X. This operation uses [2XIO_select[102X ([14X3.2-55[114X)
  to  decide  which  of the file descriptors belonging to the connections of [3Xh[103X

  possibly  updating the input and output queues. A possible serving socket is
  also  served  accepting a new connection if there is one. The operation [2XDoIO[102X
  loops  until no more file descriptors are ready. It returns [9Xtrue[109X if some I/O
