  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XIO[105X  package  contains  an implementation of the client side of the HTTP
  protocol. The basic purpose of this is of course to be able to download data
  from  web  servers  from  the  [5XGAP[105X  language. However, the HTTP protocol can
  perform a much bigger variety of tasks.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  first argument [3Xhostname[103X must be a string containing the hostname of the
  server  to connect. The second argument [3Xport[103X must be an integer in the range
  from [22X1[122X to [22X65535[122X and describes the port to connect to on the server.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function  opens  a TCP/IP connection to the server and returns a record
  [9Xconn[109X with the following components: [9Xconn.sock[109X is [9Xfail[109X if an error occurs and
  otherwise a [10XFile[110X object linked to the file descriptor of the socket. In case
  of  an  error,  the component [9Xconn.errormsg[109X contains an error message, it is
  otherwise empty. If everything went well then the component [9Xconn.host[109X is the
  result  from  the  host  name lookup (see [2XIO_gethostbyname[102X ([14X3.2-23[114X)) and the
  component [9Xconn.closed[109X is set to [9Xfalse[109X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNo data is sent or received on the socket in this function.[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ya record[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis function performs a complete HTTP request. The first argument must be a
  connection  record  as  returned  by a successful call to [2XOpenHTTPConnection[102X
  ([14X7.1-1[114X).  The argument [3Xmethod[103X must be a valid HTTP request [21Xmethod[121X in form of
  a  string. The most common will be [9XGET[109X, [9XPOST[109X, or [9XHEAD[109X. The argument [3Xuri[103X is a
  string  containing  the URI of the request, which is given in the first line
  of  the request. This will usually be a relative or absolute path name given
  to the server. The argument [3Xheader[103X must be a [5XGAP[105X record. Each bound field of
  this  record  will  we transformed into one header line with the name of the
  component  being  the  key and the value the value. All bound values must be
  strings.  The  argument  [3Xbody[103X  must  either be a string or [9Xfalse[109X. If it is a
  string, this string is sent away as the body of the request. If no string or
  an  empty  string  is  given,  no  body  will  be  sent.  The  header  field
  [9XContent-Length[109X  is automatically created from the length of the string [3Xbody[103X.
  Finally,  the argument [3Xtarget[103X can either be [9Xfalse[109X or a string. In the latter
  case,  the  body  of the request answer is written to the file with the name
  given  in  [3Xtarget[103X. The [9Xbody[109X component of the result will be the file name in
  this  case.  If  [3Xtarget[103X is false, the full body of the answer is stored into
  the [9Xbody[109X component of the result.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function sends away the request and awaits the answer. If anything goes
  wrong  during  the  transfer  (for  example  if  the  connection  is  broken
  prematurely), then the component [9Xstatuscode[109X of the resulting record is [22X0[122X and
  the  component  [9Xstatus[109X  is  a corresponding error message. In that case, all
  other  fields  may or may not be bound to sensible values, according to when
  the  error occurred. If everything goes well, then [9Xstatuscode[109X and [9Xstatus[109X are
  bound to the corresponding values coming from the request answer. [9Xstatuscode[109X
  is  transformed  into  a  [5XGAP[105X  integer.  The header of the answer is parsed,
  transformed  into  a [5XGAP[105X record, and stored into the component [9Xheader[109X of the
  result.  The  [9Xbody[109X component of the result record is set as described above.
  Finally,  the  [9Xprotoversion[109X  component  contains  the  HTTP protocol version
  number  used  by  the  server  as  a  string  and  the  boolean value [9Xclosed[109X
  indicates, whether or not the function has detected, that the connection has
  been  closed  by  the server. Note that by default, the connection will stay
  open, at least for a certain time after the end of the request.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSee  the description of the global variable [2XHTTPTimeoutForSelect[102X ([14X7.1-3[114X) for
  rules how timeouts are done in this function.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote that if the [3Xmethod[103X is [9XHEAD[109X, then no body is expected (none will be sent
  anyway) and the function returns immediately with empty body. Of course, the
  [9XContent-Length[109X  value  in  the  header is as if it the request would be done
  with the [9XGET[109X method.[133X

  [33X[1;0Y[29X[2XHTTPTimeoutForSelect[102X [32X global variable[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  global  variable  holds a list of length two. By default, both entries
  are  [9Xfail[109X  indicating that [2XHTTPRequest[102X ([14X7.1-2[114X) should never timeout and wait
  forever  for  an answer. Actually, the two values in this variable are given
  to the [2XIO_Select[102X ([14X4.3-3[114X) function call during I/O multiplexing. That is, the
  first  number  is  in  seconds and the second in milliseconds. Together they
  lead  to  a  timeout  for  the  HTTP  request. If a timeout occurs, an error
  condition  is triggered which returns a record with status code [22X0[122X and status
  being the timeout error message.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou  can  change  the  timeout  by  accessing  the two entries of this write
  protected list variable directly.[133X

  function  opens  an  HTTP  connection,  tries  a  single  HTTP  request  and
  immediately   closes  the  connection  again.  The  result  is  as  for  the
  [2XHTTPRequest[102X  ([14X7.1-2[114X)  function. If an error occurs during the opening of the
  connection, the [9Xstatuscode[109X value of the result is [22X0[122X and the error message is
