This file describes changes in the IO package.

4.9.1 (2024-11-18)
  - Various janitorial changes

4.9.0 (2024-09-05)
  - Require GAP >= 4.12 so that we can use `LoadKernelExtension`

4.8.3 (2024-07-29)
  - Validates arguments to IO_gmtime and IO_localtime

  - Add IO_getenv, IO_setenv, IO_unsetenv

4.7.3 (2022-09-25)
  - Fix a build issue where running `make clean` would break the build
    system (and hence building this package via GAP's BuildPackages.sh
    script was broken, as that always runs `make clean` first)
  - Various janitorial changes

4.7.2 (2021-10-21)
  - Change `Random( RandomSource( IsRealRandomSource, "random" ), 1, 1 )` from `fail` to `1`.

  - Add License field to PackageInfo.g
  - Fix various (harmless) compiler warnings

    (avoid including src/iostream.h, avoid C_NEW_STRING, modernize build system)

4.5.4 (2018-09-19)
  - Add IO_getcwd to query the current working directory
  - Fix ChangeDirectoryCurrent when used with relative paths
    (it used to set GAPInfo.DirectoryCurrent to an invalid value)

4.5.3 (2018-09-18)

    had not been updated)

4.5.2 (2018-08-21)
  - Add exit status to IO_WaitPid (contributed by Chris Jefferson, PR #64)
  - Make IO usable in the HPC-GAP threads (contributed by Mohamed Barakat, PR #65)

  - Move website to https://gap-packages.github.io/io/
  - Change IO_PipeThroughWithError to also return the exit status of
    the child process
  - Improve test suite a little bit
  - GAP 4.8 also provides ChangeDirectoryCurrent, so we only
    define it if it does not already exist
  - Don't wait for child processes to exit on GAP exit

  - Fix problem with IO_Pickling some very large objects
  - Add pickle support for transformations and partial
    permutations
